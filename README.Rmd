## Summary

Michael Shepertycky, PhD, came by the HMRL with the exoskeleton he's develop that can harvest energy during walking but also reduces the metabolic energy consumption of the user. We tested out how well Theia3D could track him while wearing the Exo!

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Many devices have been developed to harvest energy from walking or running, but their use often comes at cost to the wearer in the form of increased metabolic demand. Not this exoskeleton, according to a new Science study. </p>&mdash; Science Magazine <a href="https://twitter.com/ScienceMagazine/status/1398021328746201094?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 27, 2021</a></blockquote></center>

## Data Collection and Processing

3 overground walking trials were collected using Theia3D. Markerless data were collected with 8 Sony RX0II cameras with a frame rate of 60 Hz (actual 59.9401 Hz). 

An 8 Hz GCVSPL filter was applied to the markerless kinematics data. Heel strike events were kinematically determined in Visual3D and exported using the *Export_Data_To_Ascii_File* function. Data were time normalized to full gait cycles (101 points).

### Attach R packages
```{r, message=FALSE}
#library(devtools)
#install_github("jouterleys/v3dR")
library(v3dR)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(here)
```

### Build loopV3DR
```{r loopV3DR}
# Build a function to do something on each dataframe
loopV3DR <- function(full_filepath){
  
  # Add some contextual information to the dataframe
  # from each loop on import.
  
  # side information is contained in the txt filename.
  side <- strsplit(basename(full_filepath), "_")[[1]][1]
  
  # condition information is contained in the folder path
  # In this case the folder name up two directories from the txt file is the subID
  condition <- basename(dirname(dirname(full_filepath)))
  
  # Read current txt file into a dataframe and add the columns condition and side.
  df <- v3dR(full_filepath) %>%  mutate(condition = condition, side = side)
  
  return(df)
  
}
```

### Define paths and build data frame
``` {r import}
# Define path to the subject folders
resultsPath <- here('S00001')

# Create list of subjects based on subject folders
subList <- list.dirs(resultsPath, recursive=FALSE)

# Build dataframe containing all subject data
# Creates list of all txt files from within the results folder
# Then runs the loopV3DR function on each item in the list
df <- list.files(file.path(subList,'results'), pattern = "*.txt", full.names = TRUE) %>% 
  map_df(~loopV3DR(.)) 

df <- as.data.frame(df)

# The signal_names are named in visual3D as LANKLE_ANGLE, RANKLE_ANGLE, etc.
# Since we are using long data format and assign the side during import
# we will remove the first letter of the signal_name
df$signal_names <- as.factor(substring(df$signal_names, 2))
df$signal_names <- fct_relevel(df$signal_names, "ANKLE_ANGLE", "KNEE_ANGLE", "HIP_ANGLE")


```

``` {r component_labeller, echo=FALSE}
component_names <- c(
  `X`="Sagittal  Plane",
  `Y`="Frontal Plane",
  `Z`="Transverse Plane"
)

```


## Kinematics
```{r kinematics_right_fig, fig.height = 8, fig.width = 9, fig.align = "center", dpi=300, echo=TRUE, fig.cap = "Left and right lower limb joint kinematics. Note: Dorsi-flexion, knee flexion, and hip flexion are positive (+). Ankle inversion, knee adduction and hip adduction is positive (+). Toe-in, knee internal rotation, and hip internal rotation are positive (+)." }

df %>%
  subset(select = -c(c3d_name, instance)) %>%
  filter(grepl("ANGLE", signal_names)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = item, y = value, group = side, color = side)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = "black", size = 0.25) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line") +
  stat_summary(fun.data = "mean_sdl", fun.args = list(mult = 1),
               mapping = aes(color = side, fill = side),
               geom = "ribbon", alpha = 0.25, colour = NA) +
  facet_wrap(signal_components ~ signal_names, scales = "free",
             labeller = labeller(signal_components = as_labeller(component_names))) +
 theme_minimal() +
 theme(axis.line = element_line(size = 1, colour = "black"), legend.position = "top") +
 scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  xlab('Percent of Gait Cycle (%)') +
  ylab('Joint Angle (Degrees)')

```
